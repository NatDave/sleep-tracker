# Multi-User Sleep Tracker

This is a multi-user sleep tracking web app that allows multiple users to log in with a username, record their sleep times, and view a chart of their sleep data. The data is stored in the browser's Local Storage, keyed by username.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete sleep entries.
- Daily total sleep chart generated with Chart.js.
- Data is saved under each username in Local Storage.
- Export or import sleep data as JSON.
- Ideal for quick personal or family usage on a shared device.

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Enter any username to log in.
3. Add sleep entries in the form. Data auto-saves locally.
4. You may optionally export data to JSON, import later, or use a different username for separate logs.
